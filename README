Personal vim Configuration Repository
=====================================

This repository is use to hold my personal vim configurations for easy
replication to different hosts.  This repo is not meant to be checked out by
anyone else and is simply convenience for me.

Installation on a New Host
==========================

To install this vim configuration on a new host, execute the following:

cd ~
git clone http://github.com/scruffynerfherder/dotvim.git ~/.vim
ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
cd ~/.vim

Additionally, if any plugins are added as submodules, execute the following:

git submodule init
git submodule update
